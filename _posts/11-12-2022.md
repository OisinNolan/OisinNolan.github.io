title: Truth, Probability, and the A Priori
---

## Two Kinds of Knowledge
- A priori knowledge: What is it? The stuff we know. Logical rules. Maths
- Experiential knowledge: What is it? The stuff we sense, experience

## Truth
- How do we come to analytic and synthetic truths? Maths vs science

## Connecting the A Priori and the Experiential
- The A Priori has been created by experience
