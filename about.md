I've recently finished my undergrad in Computer Science and Linguistics at Trinity College, and I'm looking forward to studying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing via the MSc Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh next year (2021/2022). I'm interested in the task of representing meaning in language, which I hope to study during my masters.


Here are some projects I've worked on in recent years:
* Developed the frontend for [_NAISC-L_](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~mckennl3/naisc/), a web-framework aimed at making semantic web technologies accessible to information professionals, such as librarians and archivists.
* Developed [accname](https://github.com/google/accname), an open-source implementation of the W3C [Accessible Name Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/) algorithm, as my internship project at Google.
* Lead developer of [_An Scéalaí_](https://www.abair.tcd.ie/scealai/), an ongoing research project that is part of [the ABAIR project](https://www.abair.tcd.ie/en/about/). _An Scéalaí_ (the storyteller) is a language-learning web platform for the Irish language that doubles as a corpus collection tool.
